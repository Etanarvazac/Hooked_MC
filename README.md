# HiberniaDiscord v2.2.0: Next Step.

## Installation

I have tried to make installing and configuring the plugin be as easy as possible. We are not DiscordSRV, nor are we trying to be. 


### Prerequisites

As of the time of writing this there are no current external libraries used.

1.  :: Download the latest copy of HiberniaDiscord from the releases page.
2.  :: Move HiberniaDiscord.jar into your plugins folder
3.  :: Restart (Do *Not* Reload) your server to generate the necessary configuration files.
4.  :: Configure the plugin to use your webhook.

## Deployment

in project root:
`mvn clean package`

## Contributing

Feel free to submit a pull request, I'll get to it when I can.

## Versioning

We're following a very weak versioning system whereby

- 3.0.0: Latest.
- 2.1.0: Adds Join/Leave webhook events as well as switches to dependency injection
- 2.0.0: Rewrite and Overhaul of the entire plugin. Brings maven support.
- 1.0.0: is the initial release switching to semantic versioning
